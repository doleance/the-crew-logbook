# Crew - The quest for Planet Nine

This is a small React application to help with playing the card game called The Crew. It shows all the scenarios from the logbook and deal random goal cards; but you need to buy the game to play as it does not contain the playing cards.

## Running

To start the application just run: `npm start`,
or have a look around in package.json for more scripts.

## Building

To build the application just run: `npm run build`

## Developing

Prerequisites:

- node >= 14.0.0
- npm >= 5.6

I had created the application with:
`npx create-react-app the-crew-logbook`
The app uses Babel and Webpack under the bonnet.
